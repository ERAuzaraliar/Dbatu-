    var subject = "Urgent Attention Needed: Issues in DBATU,Lonere Examination Process.";
    var body = `Dear News Channel Team,

   I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a series of concerning issues that students at Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University,Lonere are facing due to the mismanagement of examination results and procedures. These problems are causing significant distress and uncertainty among the student body, and we believe it is essential for the media to highlight these issues to prompt corrective action from the university administration.

1. Delay in Result Publication:

According to university regulations, examination results are to be published within 45 days after the exams. However, it has been four to five months since the exams concluded, and the results have yet to be released. This prolonged delay is causing severe anxiety and disruption to students' academic plans and career prospects.

2. Inaccessible University Website:

The university website, which is essential for checking results and other activities, has been closed for the past six months. Students who need to download their previous results for scholarship applications or other purposes are unable to do so. Despite numerous complaints, there has been no response or resolution from the university, further adding to the students' frustration and hindering their academic and financial opportunities.

3. Unreasonable Form Filling Requirement:

The university has opened a window for form filling before declaring the results. This requirement is illogical and impractical, as students cannot accurately complete forms without knowing their results. This oversight demonstrates a lack of consideration for the students' needs and academic schedules.

4. Errors in Paper Checking:

Numerous students who applied for photocopies of their exam papers discovered significant mistakes made by the paper checkers. In some cases, papers were not thoroughly checked, leading to students being incorrectly marked as failed. This negligence in evaluation is unacceptable and raises serious questions about the integrity of the examination process.

5. Inaccessible Photocopies:

When students request photocopies of their exam papers to verify the results, they often receive corrupt PDF files, rendering them useless. This lack of transparency and accountability prevents students from challenging erroneous results, leaving them with no recourse to rectify mistakes.

6. Cancellation of Remedial Exams:

The university recently cancelled the remedial exams, a crucial opportunity for students to improve their grades. The cancellation notice was shared only after the delayed result declaration, leaving students with no options to recover from the errors in their evaluations. This abrupt and unfair decision further exacerbates the stress and academic setbacks for many students.

7. Arbitrary Changes to Exam Regulations:

It is concerning that the university seems to be changing exam regulations mid-stream. Such changes should only be implemented for new students admitted after the revised rules are announced. Altering rules for current students creates confusion and unfairly impacts those who are already midway through their programs.

    The cumulative impact of these issues is profoundly negative, affecting students' academic progress, mental health, and future opportunities. We urge your esteemed news channel to investigate and report on these matters to hold the university accountable and advocate for fair and timely resolution of these problems.

    Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We hope that with your support, we can bring about the necessary changes to ensure a fair and transparent examination process for all students at Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University,Lonere.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University,Lonere`;
